## A bit of History


<br><br>


A game as [any interaction between agents that is governed by a set of rules specifying the possible moves for each participant and a set of outcomes for each possible combination of moves]{.note}.



## A bit of History


<br><br>


[Nobel prizes]{.note} in Economics:

<br><br>

[1972, 1994, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2020.]{.note}


# More formally {background-color="#62259D"}


## More formally


<br>

In short, games are **formal descriptions of strategic settings**.

. . .


<br>


For our purposes, strategic settings &rarr; [interdependence]{.hi}.

. . .

- What [you]{.note} do affects [my]{.note} outcomes, and what [I]{.note} do affects [your]{.note} outcomes.


<br>


. . . 


Most of the time, [outcomes]{.note} do not imply [winning]{.hi-green} or [losing]{.hi-red}.



## More formally


<br>

We will learn a *mathematically precise and logically consistent structure*.


. . .


To start, [5]{.note} elements:

. . .

<br>

1. A *list* of *players*;

2. A complete description of what the players *can* do (i.e., their actions);

3. A description of *what* the players *know* when they act;

4. A specification of *how* the players' actions lead to *outcomes*;

5. A specification of the players' preferences over outcomes (i.e., the *payoffs*).




## More fomally

<br>

[Noncooperative]{.note} vs. [cooperative]{.note} games

. . .



<br><br>


[Individual]{.note} actions *vs*. [Contractual]{.note} relations


## More fomally

<br>


[Noncooperative]{.note} games:


. . .


<br><br>

- [Extensive]{.hi-slate} form;

- [Normal]{.hi} (strategic) form.
